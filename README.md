### Two types of recommended system in this project.
1. Movies Recommended System
2. Books Recommended System

### Movie Recommeded System
The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, ratings, posters, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org, and using the 
IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4`
